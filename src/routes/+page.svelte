			My daily routine involves crafting fullstack responsive web applications. With over 2 years of
			hands-on knowledge gained through studying web development in my free time and at Roskilde
			Technical School, I take pride in writing clean, appealing, and reusable code that's easy for
			anyone (including your grandmother) to understand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although I might be a junior in the job market, my ability to collaborate shines. I've
			successfully worked with graphic designers, managers, product owners, and fellow programmers
			on various web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			I excel in learning new technologies and languages, documenting processes, and building
			responsive frontend solutions by interacting with the backend through APIs and databases. I
			have a focus on modern technology, but adept at seamlessly integrating and adapting to older
			and preexisting tech environments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from programming, I bring other skills to the board, with a few years of experience in
			photography and photo-editing using tools like Photoshop, Camera Raw, and Capture One.
			Additionally, I've dabbled in video-editing, producing YouTube content in the past.
		</p>
		<p>
			Described by classmates, coworkers, and myself as a team player, trusted ally, and quick
			learner.

						I also make electronic music. My go-to for music magic is Ableton Live. I play around
						with synths, drum beats, and cool effects to shape my sound. Starting from 2021, I use
						Ableton's arrangement view to piece everything together. Dive into my tunes and vibe
						with the beats, hope you enjoy the ride!
